Please generate a c# code that performs the following steps:
1) Generate test data by using the Bogus library from the following link - https://github.com/bchavez/Bogus
2) The generated test data should cover a wide range of scenarios, including positive, negative, and edge cases, to ensure comprehensive testing of the application's functionality. 
3) The test data should accurately represent the expected input and output data types, formats, and values, ensuring that it is suitable for validating the application's functionality. 
4) The test data should be diverse and include different combinations of inputs, ensuring that the application is tested against a variety of scenarios. 
5) Test data should be generated in CSV format.
6) Test data should consist form two entities - 'Titles' and 'Credits'.
7) The code should generate 150 test data rows for each entity.
8) Entity 'Titles' should have a one-to-many relationship with
'Credits' entity(titles.id  is primary key in entity 'Titles' and credits.title_id is foreign key in entity 'Credits')
9) Test data for each entity should be generated in a separate file(in CSV format).
10) Please generate a c# class for 'Titles' entity with name 'Titles'.
11) 'Titles' entity should have next structure:
titles.id numeric title identifier ;
titles.title textual movie (series) name ;
titles.description textual title description ;
titles.release_year should have a Common Era year format 
titles.age_certification should be one of these: G, PG, PG-13, R, NC-17, U, U/A, A, S, AL, 6, 9, 12, 12A, 15, 18, 18R, R18, R21, M, MA15+, R16, R18+, X18, T, E, E10+, EC, C, CA, GP, M/PG, TV-Y, TV-Y7, TV-G, TV-PG, TV-14, TV-MA ;
titles.runtime should be a common title duration in minutes ;
titles.genres should contain a list of strings representing various movie (series) genres ;
titles.production_country should represent a country in ISO 3166-1 Alpha-3 code ;
titles.seasons should represent the number of seasons for series or be empty for movies;
12) 'Credits' entity should have next structure:
credits.id numeric credits identifier ;
credits.title_id corresponding title id ;
credits.real_name full credits member name ;
credits.character_name corresponding movie (series) character name; 
credits.role should represent corresponding role and be one of these: Director, Producer, Screenwriter, Actor, Actress, Cinematographer, Film Editor, Production Designer, Costume Designer, Music Composer;
12)  Generated values for property 'titles.genres'  from entity 'Titles' should be divided by character ';'
13)  Generated values for above  property 'titles.age_certification'  from entity 'Titles' should be picked from next list:  G, PG, PG-13, R, NC-17, U, U/A, A, S, AL, 6, 9, 12, 12A, 15, 18, 18R, R18, R21, M, MA15+, R16, R18+, X18, T, E, E10+, EC, C, CA, GP, M/PG, TV-Y, TV-Y7, TV-G, TV-PG, TV-14, TV-MA.
14) Generated values for property 'credits.role'  from entity 'Credits' should be picked from next list: Director, Producer, Screenwriter, Actor, Actress, Cinematographer, Film Editor, Production Designer, Costume Designer, Music Composer.
15) Method Random.Bool() from  Bogus library should be generated for the above code with arguments type float.
16)  Generated values for above  property 'titles.production_country'  from entity 'Titles' should be generatted by using method Address.CountryCode(Iso3166Format.Alpha3) from Bogus library.
